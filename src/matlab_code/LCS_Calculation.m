%      singleton*.
%
%      H = LCS_Calculation returns the handle to a new LCS_Calculation or
%      the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      LCS_Calculation('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in LCS_Calculation.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      LCS_Calculation('Property','Value',...) creates a new LCS_Calculation or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before LCS_Calculation_OpeningFunction gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to LCS_Calculation_OpeningFcn via varargin.

% SORTN - Sort cell array or char array in textual and numerical mode.
%               Primary sort by first letter, secondary by second letter and so on.
%               Numbers are considered an numerical values.
%               
%               Sorting Rules:
%                           'a' comes before 'b' and so on.
%                           Numbers come before letters
%                           Numbers are compared according to their value
%                           Short string comes before a long one (when first chars are identical) 
%                           Ignore characters that are not letters or
%                           numbers.
%                           SORTN is NOT case sensitive.
%
%               The main interest in this function is that it can sort
